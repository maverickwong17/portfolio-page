# portfolio-page

## Description 

This is a portfolio of me. It gives you an overview of me as a person and of my work.
This will continue to be updated as I undertake more projects and have a deeper understanding of web developement in general. There are some bugs I was unable to resolve in the CSS stylesheet.
